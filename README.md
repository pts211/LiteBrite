# LiteBrite

LiteBrite is a project created for Cerner's DevCon 2019. It's original purpose was to be an interactive piece at the conference for spectators to play with. However, due to many facotrs it was decided to design a much more versitle system. This LiteBrite is more of an interactive display.
