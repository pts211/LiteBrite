# LiteBrite

LiteBrite is a project created for Cerner's DevCon 2019. Its original purpose was to be an interactive piece at the conference for spectators to play with. In throwing around ideas it was determined we could build something that would allow for more uses in the future. This LiteBrite is more of an interactive display.
